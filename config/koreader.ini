; This is a working example of a full config file to setup a new watch.
; You can only define a *single* watch per ini file, and the section name *needs* to be "watch".
[watch]
; Those next two keys are MANDATORY
filename = /mnt/onboard/koreader.png			; Absolute path of the icon to watch for
action = /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/koreader.sh	; Absolute path of the command to launch when the icon is opened
; The following keys are NOT mandatory
label = KOReader					; Label available for use by a GUI frontend
hidden = 0						; Whether to hide this entry from a GUI frontend
block_spawns = 1					; Prevents *any* script from being launched via KFMon while the command launched by this watch is still running.
							; This is useful for document readers, because they could otherwise trigger unwanted
							; behavior through their file manager, metadata reader, or thumbnailer.
do_db_update = 0					; Do we want to update Nickel's DB for this icon? (Potentially unsafe, disabled by default)
; If you enabled do_db_update, the next three keys NEED to be set
db_title = KOReader					; Title to use for the icon's Library entry if do_db_update = 1
db_author = KOReader Devs				; Author to use for the icon's Library entry if do_db_update = 1
db_comment = An eBook reader application		; Comment to use for the icon's Library entry if do_db_update = 1


; This is not part of the actual KFMon config, it's just a sentinel value used by the KOReader startup script.
; If you encounter weird Nickel behavior after exiting KOReader, set this to true
; On some HW/FW combos, this may translate into wonky power management.
; For instance, and somewhat more severely, on my H2O, the IR grid touchscreen will often never wakeup after a suspend.
; I've also seen broken USBMS behavior on some newer FW versions, so, that's fun, too...
